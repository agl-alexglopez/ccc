# C Container Collection (CCC)

The C Container Collection offers a variety of containers for C programmers who want fine-grained control of memory in their programs. All containers offer both allocating and non-allocating interfaces. This means it is possible to write a program in which a container never allocates or frees a single byte of your memory. For the motivations of why such a library is helpful in C read on.

## Installation

Currently, this library supports a manual installation via CMake. See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for more details.

## Quick Start

Read the documentation [HERE](https://agl-alexglopez.github.io/ccc). If you want to dive in right away, it may be best to start with [`types.h`](https://agl-alexglopez.github.io/ccc/files.html) to acquaint yourself with the `ccc_alloc_fn` abstraction and decide if you need allocating or non-allocating containers in your project.

## Design

`WIP`
