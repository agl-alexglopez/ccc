# C Container Collection (CCC)

This repository contains various data structures written to support C programmers across many disciplines. This library is a byproduct of working with the `pintOS` operating system at Stanford University. It is designed around giving the programmer maximum control over their memory; specifically this library is focussed on giving the programmer maximum control over how and when memory is allocated and deallocated.

## Build Instructions

Work in progress. Full library installation instructions via CMake are coming as soon.
