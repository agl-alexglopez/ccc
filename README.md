# C Container Collection (CCC)

This repository contains various data structures written to support C programmers across many disciplines. This library is a byproduct of working with the `pintOS` operating system at Stanford University. It is designed around giving the programmer maximum control over their memory; specifically this library is focussed on giving the programmer maximum control over how and when memory is allocated and deallocated.

## Installation

Currently, this library supports a manual installation via CMake. See the [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md) file for more details.

## Quick Start

Read the documentation [HERE](https://agl-alexglopez.github.io/ccc).

## About

These containers are functional, but still a work in progress. A release version is not yet ready. All containers provided by this library can be viewed in the [`ccc/`](/ccc/) folder. More details on usage and design of the library is coming soon.
