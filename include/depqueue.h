/* Author: Alexander G. Lopez
   --------------------------
   This is the Double Ended Priority Queue interface implemented via Splay
   Tree. In this case we modify a Splay Tree to allow for
   a Double Ended Priority Queue (aka a sorted Multi-Set). See the
   normal set interface as well. While a Red-Black Tree
   would be the more optimal data structure to support
   a DEPQ the underlying implementation of a Splay Tree
   offers some interesting tradeoffs for systems programmers.
   They are working sets that keep frequently (Least
   Recently Used) elements close to the root even if their
   runtime is amortized O(lgN). With the right use cases we
   can frequently benefit from O(1) operations. */
