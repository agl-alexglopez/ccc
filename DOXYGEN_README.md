# CCC DOC

## Usage

Welcome to the doc! Follow the links below to become familiar with the collection.

- [ccc](https://agl-alexglopez.github.io/ccc/files.html) - The collection of containers. Click the header for the desired container to view its interface.
    - Each `*.h` file listed contains the entire interface for that container.
    - All types and functions are listed at the top of each page.
    - All types and functions have links to the extended documentation below.
    - Because Doxygen takes directly from the source files the same documentation can be read directly in the header files distributed with the library.
- [types.h](https://agl-alexglopez.github.io/ccc/types_8h.html) - The fundamental types that all containers use.
    - Become familiar with the memory allocation interface and memory permissions.
    - Understand the Entry and Handle interfaces for efficient associative container operations.
- [traits.h](https://agl-alexglopez.github.io/ccc/traits_8h.html) - Generic versions of shared functionality across containers.
    - Write more expressive less distracting code with shorter naming.
    - Combine shared functionality across containers with one united interface.

## Installation

- [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) - See the installation instructions for how to incorporate the C Container Collection into your project.
