@brief The Flat Hash Map Interface

A Flat Hash Map stores elements by hash value and allows the user to retrieve
them by key in amortized O(1). Elements in the table may be copied and moved,
especially when rehashing occurs, so no pointer stability is available in this
implementation.

A flat hash map requires the user to provide a type, pointers to positions in a
contiguous array, a hash function, and a key comparator function. The hash
function should be well tailored to the key being stored in the table to prevent
collisions. Good variety in the upper bits of the hashed value will also result
in faster performance. Currently, the flat hash map does not offer any default
hash functions or hash strengthening algorithms so strong hash functions should
be obtained by the user for the data set.

To shorten names in the interface, define the following preprocessor directive
at the top of your file.

```
#define FLAT_HASH_MAP_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
```

All types and functions can then be written without the `ccc_` prefix. */

are required (see ccc_fhm_declare_fixed_map). */
/**@{*/

/** @brief Declare a fixed size map type for use in the stack, heap, or data
segment. Does not return a value.
@param [in] fixed_map_type_name the user chosen name of the fixed sized map.
@param [in] key_val_type_name the type the user plans to store in the map. It
may have a key and value field as well as any additional fields. For set-like
behavior, wrap a field in a struct/union (e.g. `union int_elem {int e;};`).
@param [in] capacity the power of two capacity for the map.
@warning the capacity must be a power of two greater than 8 or 16, depending on
the platform (e.g. 16, 32, 64, etc.).

Once the type has been declared, two fields will be available, .data and .tag.
Once the location for the fixed size map is chosen--stack, heap, or data
segment--provide those two fields to the initializer for a flat hash map as
follows:

```
struct val
{
    int key;
    int val;
};
ccc_fhm_declare_fixed_map(small_fixed_map, struct val, 64);
static small_fixed_map mem;
static ccc_flat_hash_map static_fh
    = fhm_init(mem.data, mem.tag, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq, NULL,
               NULL, ccc_fhm_fixed_capacity(small_fixed_map));
```

Similarly, a fixed size map can be used on the stack.

```
struct val
{
    int key;
    int val;
};
ccc_fhm_declare_fixed_map(small_fixed_map, struct val, 64);
int main(void)
{
    small_fixed_map mem;
    ccc_flat_hash_map stack_fh
        = fhm_init(mem.data, mem.tag, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq, NULL,
                   NULL, ccc_fhm_fixed_capacity(small_fixed_map));
    return 0;
}
```

The ccc_fhm_fixed_capacity macro can be used to obtain the previously provided
capacity when declaring the fixed map type. Finally, one could allocate a fixed
size map on the heap; however, it is usually better to initialize a dynamic
map and use the ccc_fhm_reserve function for such a use case.

This macro is not needed when a dynamic resizing flat hash map is needed. For
dynamic maps see the ccc_fhm_init macro. */

               NULL, ccc_fhm_fixed_capacity(small_fixed_map));
```

Initialize a dynamic hash table at compile time with allocation permission and
no auxiliary data. Use the same type as the previous example.

```
struct val
{
    int key;
    int val;
};
// Hash, equality, and allocation functions are defined by the user.
static ccc_flat_hash_map static_fh
    = fhm_init((struct val *)NULL, NULL, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq,
               std_alloc, NULL, 0);
```

Initialization at runtime is also possible. Stack-based or dynamic maps are
identical to the provided examples, except without the `static` keyword in a
runtime context. */

than the source capacity and no allocation function is provided an input error
is returned. If resizing is required and resizing of dst fails a memory error
is returned.
@note dst must have capacity greater than or equal to src. If dst capacity is
less than src, an allocation function must be provided with the fn argument.

Note that there are two ways to copy data from source to destination: provide
sufficient memory and pass NULL as fn, or allow the copy function to take care
of allocation for the copy.

Manual memory management with no allocation function provided.

```
#define FLAT_HASH_MAP_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
struct val
{
    int key;
    int val;
};
ccc_fhm_declare_fixed_map(small_fixed_map, struct val, 64);
static small_fixed_map mem_a;
static ccc_flat_hash_map src
    = fhm_init(mem_a.data, mem_a.tag, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq, NULL,
               NULL, ccc_fhm_fixed_capacity(small_fixed_map));

               NULL, ccc_fhm_fixed_capacity(small_fixed_map));
ccc_result res = fhm_copy(&dst, &src, NULL);
```

The above requires dst capacity be greater than or equal to src capacity. Here
is memory management handed over to the copy function.

```
#define FLAT_HASH_MAP_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
struct val
{
    int key;
    int val;
};
static ccc_flat_hash_map src
    = fhm_init((struct val *)NULL, NULL, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq,
               std_alloc, NULL, 0);
insert_rand_vals(&src);
static flat_hash_map dst
    = fhm_init((struct val *)NULL, NULL, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq,
               std_alloc, NULL, 0);
ccc_result res = fhm_copy(&dst, &src, std_alloc);
```

The above allows dst to have a capacity less than that of the src as long as
copy has been provided an allocation function to resize dst. Note that this
would still work if copying to a destination that the user wants as a fixed
size map.

```
#define FLAT_HASH_MAP_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
struct val
{
    int key;
    int val;
};
static ccc_flat_hash_map src
    = fhm_init((struct val *)NULL, NULL, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq,
               std_alloc, NULL, 0);
insert_rand_vals(&src);
static flat_hash_map dst
    = fhm_init((struct val *)NULL, NULL, key, fhmap_int_to_u64, fhmap_id_eq,
               NULL, NULL, 0);
ccc_result res = fhm_copy(&dst, &src, std_alloc);
```

The above sets up dst with fixed size while src is a dynamic map. Because an
allocation function is provided, the dst is resized once for the copy and
retains its fixed size after the copy is complete. This would require the user
to manually free the underlying buffer at dst eventually if this method is used.
Usually it is better to allocate the memory with the reserve function if fixed
size dynamic maps are required.

These options allow users to stay consistent across containers with their
memory management strategies. */

prevent a map from growing unbounded due to internal decisions about rehashes
and resizing. The user in this case knows the map does not have allocation
permission and therefore no further memory will be dedicated to the map.

map has no ability to free itself. Just as the allocation function is required
to reserve memory so to is it required to free memory.
